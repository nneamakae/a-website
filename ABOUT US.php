			</h3>
				<p>Louis Eugene Bautain, was born on 17th February,1796, at 	Rue Beau Bourg, Paris. 
					 he must be patient with himself. It is about speaking in freedom even iHe was the son of Jean Charles Bautain and Marie Catherine Alleton. He received some schooling in de l' Estrapade. 
					A lovely and intelligent youngster, he applied himself seriously to his studies. In 1814, at the age of eighteen, he entered the Ecole Norm Literature, but he soon showed a flair for abstract reasoning, and in particular, excelled in philosophical studies. 
					After a serious illness which led to his conversion under the spiritual guidance of Louise Humanne, he trained for, and was ordained a Roman Catholic Priest. 
					Bautain was a lover of truth, and truth as he saw it, is essentially one, since all the truth the human mind can grasp have their source in God. Truth is light and wisdom. It is life-giving and heart-warming.
					Truth wins people to itself by gentleness. Truth is not simply a matter of intellectual conviction. It is a call to action. Truth requires complete honesty. And as Bautain and his friends knew from experience, it can cost terribly. But truth is above all, a Person, Jesus Christ the Word of God.
					Love was the life principle of Bautain. Love was vital to his mission which is the bring back all souls to unity. It is the visible sign of his serenity and gentleness of his mission.
					The spirituality of Bautain was rooted in a simple faith in God's love and caring providence which had its way in the different and various circumstances of his life and mission. 
					He was a very simple man, putting aside philosopher's inclination to analyze everything and accepting thatf one's opinion is not accepted. It is about giving and accepting help. 
					Louis Bautain's life of simplicity and love of truth challenges us in our age and time to live more simply, that all may simply live.
