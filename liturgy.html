			Catholics preparing to receive Baptism, first Holy Communion and Confirmation, attend catechism classes on Saturdays 3:30 p.m. and on Sundays, once a month. There, they are taught about the Christian faith and beliefs. They study the scriptures and are guided to have a personal relationship with God. They also get to know more about the Catholic Church and her doctrines. At the end of each second term, at anniversary of the dedication of the School Chapel, the students receive the sacraments administered by the Bishop and the Parish Priest</p>

<h5>Retreat/Recollection</h5>
During Lenten and advent seasons, a day of recollection is always organized for staff and students. Recollection is the time we take stock of our lives and ask ourselves fundamental questions such as: What is my relationship with God like? Who am I coming from and where am I going? Relevant talks are given and scripture passages are given to students and staff to pray with on their own. It is usually a day of silence, a day of reflection. For the Catholics, arrangement is made for individual confession. Counselling is open to all.

Vision of LGHS- Future women of integrity.
Am I focused on the? What is my own vision?
The life of a tree depends on the depths of its roots. You carry within you the future and a considerable responsibility. After God, the future depends on us. We are little plants but there is a place for all in the field of the church and in the garden of the Father, who does not take back his gifts. (From the archives of the sisters of St. Louis)
