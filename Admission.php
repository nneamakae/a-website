					The process of admitting candidates into Louisville Girls High School is divided into two phases. The first phase is a written examination in Mathematics, English Language and Aptitude test. The second phase is a face-to-face interview of the prospective students and their parents by the principal. This admission process starts with the purchase of forms from September of the previous year through to the examination day which is usually the first Saturday in March.

				<h4 id="age">AGE CONSIDERATION</h4>
				<p>
					In LGHS, a new intake into JS1 must have turned (10) by August of the Year of entry into the school.A student in the boarding house must be mature enough to take good care of herself,carry out normal daily routine, and still be able to face her studies squarely. Also, this age limitation is to ensure the girls are at least 16 years old when leaving the school. We hope parents would understand this stance of the school and co-operate with us to produce mature ladies for the next phase of their lives.
